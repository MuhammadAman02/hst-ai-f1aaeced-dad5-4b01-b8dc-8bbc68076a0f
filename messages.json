Let's design a beautiful and functional app for managing and displaying information about various dog breeds. We'll draw inspiration from modern, clean designs with a focus on showcasing dog images and providing easy access to breed information.\n\nHere's what we'll implement in this first version:\n\n1. A homepage with a grid of dog breed cards\n2. Each card will display an image of the dog breed and its name\n3. Clicking on a card will open a modal with more detailed information about the breed\n4. A search bar to filter dog breeds\n5. A responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices\n\nFor the design, we'll use a clean and modern aesthetic:\n\n- Colors: We'll use a palette of blues and grays, with white for the background\n- Main color: #3B82F6 (a vibrant blue)\n- Secondary color: #1E40AF (a darker blue for accents)\n- Background color: #F3F4F6 (a light gray)\n- Text color: #111827 (a dark gray, almost black)\n- Font: We'll use the 'Inter' font from Google Fonts for a modern look\n- Animations: We'll add subtle hover effects on the cards and a smooth transition for the modal\n- Layout: We'll use a responsive grid layout for the dog breed cards\n\nLet's start implementing this design:\n\n\nWe'll be working on the following files:\n1. src/pages/Index.tsx (main page)\n2. src/components/DogCard.tsx (individual dog breed card)\n3. src/components/DogModal.tsx (modal for detailed breed information)\n4. src/components/SearchBar.tsx (search functionality)\n5. tailwind.config.ts (custom styling)\n6. src/index.css (custom CSS and font import)\n\nFirst, let's update the Tailwind configuration and add custom CSS:\n\n\nimport type { Config } from \"tailwindcss\"\n\nconst config = {\n  darkMode: [\"class\"],\n  content: [\n    './pages/**/*.{ts,tsx}',\n    './components/**/*.{ts,tsx}',\n    './app/**/*.{ts,tsx}',\n    './src/**/*.{ts,tsx}',\n\t],\n  prefix: \"\",\n  theme: {\n    container: {\n      center: true,\n      padding: \"2rem\",\n      screens: {\n        \"2xl\": \"1400px\",\n      },\n    },\n    extend: {\n      colors: {\n        border: \"hsl(var(--border))\",\n        input: \"hsl(var(--input))\",\n        ring: \"hsl(var(--ring))\",\n        background: \"hsl(var(--background))\",\n        foreground: \"hsl(var(--foreground))\",\n        primary: {\n          DEFAULT: \"#3B82F6\",\n          foreground: \"hsl(var(--primary-foreground))\",\n        },\n        secondary: {\n          DEFAULT: \"#1E40AF\",\n          foreground: \"hsl(var(--secondary-foreground))\",\n        },\n        destructive: {\n          DEFAULT: \"hsl(var(--destructive))\",\n          foreground: \"hsl(var(--destructive-foreground))\",\n        },\n        muted: {\n          DEFAULT: \"hsl(var(--muted))\",\n          foreground: \"hsl(var(--muted-foreground))\",\n        },\n        accent: {\n          DEFAULT: \"hsl(var(--accent))\",\n          foreground: \"hsl(var(--accent-foreground))\",\n        },\n        popover: {\n          DEFAULT: \"hsl(var(--popover))\",\n          foreground: \"hsl(var(--popover-foreground))\",\n        },\n        card: {\n          DEFAULT: \"hsl(var(--card))\",\n          foreground: \"hsl(var(--card-foreground))\",\n        },\n      },\n      borderRadius: {\n        lg: \"var(--radius)\",\n        md: \"calc(var(--radius) - 2px)\",\n        sm: \"calc("
